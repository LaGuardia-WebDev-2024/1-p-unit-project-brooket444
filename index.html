<h1><center>FASHION CHOICES IN 2024 AND WHATS COMING BACK</center></h1>
<html><center>Throughout 2024, we saw that the style from years ago making an apperance now. For example, the younger groups started bringing back clothes from the years 2013,2014,2015, and even 2016.</html>
    <head> But why?? Fashion moves so fast, to the point we can never fully be on trend with the "new thing" that is being publicized. If we take a look closer to the summer of 2024, early spring, various things starting coming back and being suddenly desired, for example wedge sneakers, specifically Isabel Marants. If someone had publicized these sneakers before their uprise they would've been shamed for liking them. But what has changed?? Suddenly everyone wants them, everyone wants them so bad to the point the lowest price you can get for them is 400. Do we only want things when we can't have them? Do we only want things when they are socially accepted?? Do we only want things when suddenly it becomes a compition to have them??</center>

    </head> The thing is fashion is constanly evolving, that's one of the reasons I love and enjoy it so much, as well as the freedom to express yourself however you would like to. It allows us to see a little into people with a glance.
